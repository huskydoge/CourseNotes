Random codes and joint typicality: Power constraints and the random variables are continuous

>[!note] Generation of the codebook:


We generate the codewords $\left(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\right)$ with each element i.i.d. according to a normal distribution with variance $P-\epsilon$. Since for large $n$,
$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum x_i^2 \rightarrow P-\epsilon
$$
The probability that a codeword <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">does not satisfy the power constraint will be small. </mark>
Let $X_i(w), \quad i=1,2, \ldots, n, w=1,2, \ldots, 2^{n R}$ be i.i.d. $\sim \mathcal{N}(0, P-\epsilon)$, forming codewords $X^n(1), X^n(2), \ldots, X^n\left(2^{n R}\right) \in \mathcal{R}^n$

>[!note] Encoding:
- The codebook is revealed to both the sender and the receiver.
- To send the message index $w$, sends the $w$ th codeword $X^n(w)$ in the codebook.


>[!note] Decoding: 


The receiver looks down the list of codewords $\left\{X^n(w)\right\}$ and searches for one that is jointly typical with the received vector.
- If there is one and only one such codeword $X^n(w)$, the receiver declares $\widehat{W}=w$ to be the transmitted codeword.
- Otherwise, the receiver declares an error. The receiver also declares an error if the chosen codeword does not satisfy the power constraint.
