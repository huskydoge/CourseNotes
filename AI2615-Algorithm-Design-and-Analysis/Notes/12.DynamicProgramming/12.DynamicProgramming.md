1. Design a recursive Algorithm.
2. Merge the common subproblems.
3. Check whether we are in a DAG and find the topological order of this DAG. (usually, by hand.)
4. Solve & store the subproblems by the topological order.

## 最优二叉树问题
$f(i,j)$是i到j组成的最优二叉树
$$f(i,j)=\min_{i\le k\le j}(f(i,k-1)+f(k+1,j)+\sum_{s=1}^j t_s)$$
